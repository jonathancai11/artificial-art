# Generative Adverserial Network (GAN) creating landscape artwork

Since we such poor artists ourselves, we decided to see if computers could do a better job.

[GANs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generative_adversarial_network) are capable of some pretty incredible things.

We were heavily inspired by the incredible work of [Robbie Barrat](https://github.com/robbiebarrat/art-DCGAN).

See our poster that we presented below.
